Version 0.2.5
	+ New files in the nosetests. These include test_classification.py and
	test_forest.
	+ Bugs fixed on classification and forest
	+ New class tree.SubTree to select the crossover points based on the sub-tree.
	This class made a significant change in forest.py
	+ New parameter in tree.Tree (select_root) it is to decide whether the root
	is admissible as crossover point
	+ New class ClassificationPDE. This class selects the crossover point based on
	the partial derivative error
	+ New method SimpleGP.tree_params used to instantiate the tree module
	+ New example, it shows how can be used SimpleGP to create prototypes for
	classification. It addresses the iris dataset.
Version 0.2.6
	+ Minor bug in the classification. The dependent variable is now an integer
	+ Setting a flag to indicate the timeout and then exit the evolution
	+ GPwRestart goes an infinite cycle parameter ntimes is equal or less than 0
	+ Minor bug in cl_argmax
	+ The Classification class should be subclass of SubTreeXO to keep the output function in the root.
	+ Setting to Classification class the predict method.
Version 0.2.7
	+ SimpleGP.predict receives an optimal parameter that indicates which individual is used in the prediction
	+ SimpleGP.init_cl to create a new instance of the class 
	+ Bug in GPwRestart it requires to overwrite on_exit to set self._run to true
	+ A new class SubTreeXOPDE is added this class uses PDE
	+ The init_cl method is added to Classification and GPPDE
	+ Some tricks in setup.py in order to compile in OSX
