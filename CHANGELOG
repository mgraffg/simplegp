Version 0.2.5
	+ New files in the nosetests. These include test_classification.py and
	test_forest.
	+ Bugs fixed on classification and forest
	+ New class tree.SubTree to select the crossover points based on the sub-tree.
	This class made a significant change in forest.py
	+ New parameter in tree.Tree (select_root) it is to decide whether the root
	is admissible as crossover point
	+ New class ClassificationPDE. This class selects the crossover point based on
	the partial derivative error
	+ New method SimpleGP.tree_params used to instantiate the tree module
	+ New example, it shows how can be used SimpleGP to create prototypes for
	classification. It addresses the iris dataset.
Version 0.2.6
	+ Minor bug in the classification. The dependent variable is now an integer
	+ Setting a flag to indicate the timeout and then exit the evolution
	+ GPwRestart goes an infinite cycle parameter ntimes is equal or less than 0
	+ Minor bug in cl_argmax
	+ The Classification class should be subclass of SubTreeXO to keep the output function in the root.
	+ Setting to Classification class the predict method.
Version 0.2.7
	+ SimpleGP.predict receives an optimal parameter that indicates which individual is used in the prediction
	+ SimpleGP.init_cl to create a new instance of the class 
	+ Bug in GPwRestart it requires to overwrite on_exit to set self._run to true
	+ A new class SubTreeXOPDE is added this class uses PDE
	+ The init_cl method is added to Classification and GPPDE
	+ Some tricks in setup.py in order to compile in OSX
	+ The method Classification.predict did not take care of nan or inf, now it returns a nan when it finds a nan or inf
	+ SimpleGA.stats returns False if it is not call at the end of the generation otherwise returns true
	+ SimpleGA.runs returns True if the run ended when the maximum number of evaluations is reached otherwise returns False
Version 0.2.8
	+ setup.py reads the VERSION file to set the version in itself and in the __init__.p
	+ SimpleGA.init_cl is included
	+ The method SimpleGA.run_cl creates a instance that does not output nan or inf neither in the training set nor a test set (in the case is given)
	+ SimpleGA has a decent amount of documentation
	+ GPwRestart has some minor modifications. The most important is that the argument ntimes in run now is pass at the constructor.
Version 0.2.9
	+ It is tested (in new_best) that the best individual found so far can predict withouth nan and inf the test set. The test set is given in the function set_test
	+ SimpleGA has doctest
